      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He&#39;d tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind.&quot;,

He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn&#39;t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.&quot;,

The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn&#39;t and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.&quot;,

He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn&#39;t make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.&quot;,

No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn&#39;t run out, so don&#39;t try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn&#39;t have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.&quot;,

The type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.&quot;,

She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they had and she didn&#39;t.&quot;,

He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness. Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn&#39;t.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;He wandered down the stairs and into the basement. The damp, musty smell of un-use hung in the air. A single, small window let in a glimmer of light, but this simply made the shadows in the basement deeper. He inhaled deeply and looked around at a mess that had been accumulating for over 25 years. He was positive that this was the place he wanted to live.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s an unfortunate reality that we don&#39;t teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn&#39;t mean they are easy and that you won&#39;t have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you&#39;re willing to open your mind a bit you don&#39;t have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.&quot;,

But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust.&quot;,

So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.&quot;,

He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn&#39;t and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Dave wasn&#39;t exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament. He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn&#39;t make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;This is important to remember. Love isn&#39;t like pie. You don&#39;t need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn&#39;t run out, so don&#39;t try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.&quot;,

And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.&quot;,

He was positive that this was the place he wanted to live.&quot;,

That doesn&#39;t mean they are easy and that you won&#39;t have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you&#39;re willing to open your mind a bit you don&#39;t have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.&quot;,

      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn&#39;t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.&quot;,

There are parents who don&#39;t like to hear their little girl crying at night, at the vast approaching dark of sleep, and so in their torment think why not feed her a lollipop, and a few years later that kid&#39;s got seven cavities and a pulled tooth.&quot;,

He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn&#39;t make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.&quot;,

The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn&#39;t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.&quot;,
